temporary notes..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    should we put all 'global' gui resources in SAT_Global.GUI,
    and have some lazy creation stuff there? (refcount?)

    x11:
        separate display connection per window
        glx needs display and targe drawable

    win32:
        window needs (global) WNDCLASS, created from global HINSTANCE (from DllMain)
        surface needs dc (can get it from screen using nullptr)
        painter wands dc (from hwnd)
        wgl needs hwnd, and dc (created from hwnd)

    nanovg
        context is 'global'
        nanovg surface & painter needs context

        (github: "At first I used a separate NanoVG context and GLFW context per window.
        However, this leads to weird difficulties down the road. I ended up using shared context")

    cairo surface
        win32: dc
        xcb: connection, drawable, visual
        xrender: conection, screen, drawable, xrender pictformat

    so.. everything except nanovg is per window..
    (maybe opengl context too)
